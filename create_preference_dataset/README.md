what does my script?

1) transfers files into APPS/preference and creates a sample call for non-class tasks
2) For each non-class task, creates monkeytype annotation
3) create inputs for the task
4) create outputs for the task
5) bring the rest of the data into preference folder and delete unnecessary files
